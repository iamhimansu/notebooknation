                            <p class="uk-article-meta uk-text-emphasis">Written by <a href="#">Niharikha G</a> on 12 April 2020. Posted in <a href="#">Blog</a></p>
                            <p class="uk-text-lead">It was a bleak Friday afternoon, and after a hectic day at the college, I was returning home on the bus. As usual, I was preoccupied with my thoughts and plans, about what I had to study and the amount of time I had to devote to my assignments.</p>
                            <p class="uk-text-truncate">The atmosphere outside was not helping me and I was feeling irritated. Looking around on the bus, I could see everyoneâ€™s head buried in their phone. But my eye caught the eye of a baby girl, whose mother was pampering her, and I could hear her cooing and laughing in the sing-song, honeyed voice of hers with no care for the world, and unconsciously I too started giggling. For a moment, I too became a child, where everything in the world seemed lighter and more funnier. All my worries dissipated and I felt inner peace, a calmness suffusing into my blood and making me feel lighter. It was then I wondered, how often did I giggle or laugh, with joy, and just laugh as today is going to be my last day. </p>
